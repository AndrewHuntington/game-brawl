## About

**Game Brawl** is an app that I created to practice requesting information from a database via an API via JavaScript. Users type in the names of two games that they wish to compare, and then relevent data is fetched from a game information database via their API and displayed to the user. The game with the most green squares is the winner.

## Technology Used

- Data and API provided by [RAWG](https://rawg.io/).
- [Aixos](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) is used to make fetching data from the API a little easier.
- [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) is used to help with styling.
- Logo icon is provided by [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).
- Everything else is HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript

## Known Issues

- This app is for entertainment purposes only, and is no way an accurate comparision between two games. Some games may be so different that they can hardly be compared at all. This project was mostly for me to practice dealing with getting and displaying data from a third party API.
- The data provided by the database is sometimes...questionable at best.
- Error handling is almost non-existent.
- I should attribute RAWG on the landing page.
- There are some TODOs left in the code that would be nice to implement.
